		p.font-bold CAUTION: WORKING WITH LYE IS DANGEROUS
		p Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) are highly caustic chemicals that can cause severe burns, blindness, and other serious injuries if mishandled.

		h2 Essential Safety Gear (PPE)
		ul
			li **Eye Protection:** Always wear chemical splash goggles. Regular glasses are NOT sufficient.
			li **Gloves:** Wear chemical-resistant gloves (neoprene or nitrile). Latex may not provide enough protection for long exposure.
			li **Clothing:** Wear long sleeves, long pants, and closed-toe shoes to protect your skin.

	section
		h2 Workspace Safety
		ul
			li **Ventilation:** Work in a well-ventilated area. Lye fumes can be irritating to the respiratory system.
			li **No Distractions:** Keep children and pets away from the workspace.
			li **Materials:** Use heat-resistant containers (stainless steel or heavy-duty plastic like HDPE or PP). NEVER use aluminum, as lye reacts with it to produce hydrogen gas.

	section
		h2 First Aid
		ul
			li **Skin Contact:** Immediately rinse with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing. Vinegear can be used to neutralize lye on surfaces, but water is best for skin.
			li **Eye Contact:** Flush with water immediately for at least 15 minutes and seek medical attention.
			li **Ingestion:** Do NOT induce vomiting. Drink water or milk and call a poison control center immediately.

		p This calculator is a tool to assist in soap making. While we strive for accuracy, we cannot guarantee the results. Lye purity, oil properties, and measurements can vary.
		p **ALWAYS:**
		ul
			li Run your recipe through multiple calculators to verify lye amounts.
			li Start with a small test batch.
			li Test the pH of your final soap before use.
