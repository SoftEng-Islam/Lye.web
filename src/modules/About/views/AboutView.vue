	h1 About Lye.web

	section
		h2 Our Mission
		p Lye.web was built with a simple mission: to provide soap makers with a modern, accurate, and safe tool to formulate their recipes. We believe that soap making is both an art and a science, and we want to remove the guesswork from the science part so you can focus on the art.

	section
		h2 Why Safety First?
		p As soap makers ourselves, we know the risks involved in handling lye. That's why we've built safety warnings and checks directly into our calculator. We want to ensure that every batch you make is safe to use and that you are protected while making it.

	section
		h2 The Technology
		p This calculator is built using the latest web technologies to ensure speed, accuracy, and offline capability. We are constantly updating our oil database and features based on community feedback.

	section
		h2 Meet the Developer
		p [Developer Name/Bio Placeholder] - Passionate about coding and chemistry.
