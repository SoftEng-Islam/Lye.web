# 1. Water as % of Oils

**Definition:**
Water is calculated as a percentage of total oils.

**Formula:**
Water = Oil Weight × (Water % / 100)

**Typical range:**
30–38% of oils (most calculators default to ~33%).

**Example:**
Oil weight = 1000 g
Water% = 33%
Water = 1000 × 0.33 = **330 g**

**Pros:**

- Simple.
- Works reliably for most recipes.

**Cons:**

- Not very precise for advanced control.
- Doesn't account for the amount of lye.

# 2. Lye Concentration

**Definition:**
Percentage of NaOH (lye) in the total lye solution.

**Formula:**
Lye Concentration = NaOH / (NaOH + Water)

Rearranged to find water:
**Water = (NaOH / Lye Concentration) − NaOH**

**Typical range:** 28% to 40%

- Low concentration = more water (slower trace)
- High concentration = less water (faster trace)

**Example:**
NaOH needed = 140 g
Target concentration = 33% (0.33)
Water = (140 / 0.33) − 140
Water = 424.24 − 140
Water = **284.24 g**

# 3. Water : Lye Ratio

**Definition:**
A direct ratio of water to NaOH weight (e.g., 2:1, 2.5:1, 3:1).

**Formula:**
Water = NaOH × Ratio

**Typical range:**
2:1 to 3:1

- 2:1 = low water, fast trace

- 2.5:1 = common

- 3:1 = high water, slower trace, safer for beginners

**Example:**
NaOH = 140 g
Ratio = 2.5:1
Water = 140 × 2.5 = **350 g**
