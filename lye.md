Here is a clear, practical breakdown of the types of lye used in soap making, how they differ, how they change formulas, and what to watch for. This is important because the type of lye determines how much water and oil you need.

1. Two Main Types of Lye
   There are only two true lyes:

Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)
Potassium Hydroxide (KOH)
Both are strong alkalis used to convert fats/oils into soap (saponification), but they produce different soap textures.

2. Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)
   Used for: solid bar soap (cold process, hot process).
   Physical form: white flakes or beads.
   Purity: usually 95–100%.

Properties:
Makes hard, long-lasting bars.
Produces a firm structure.
Requires less water than KOH.
Formula Behavior:
Low solubility compared to KOH, so water amount matters for trace and gel.
Water ratios like 2:1–3:1 are common.
Lye concentration is usually 28–40%.
Important:
Always calculate the exact NaOH needed using a soap calculator; each oil has its own SAP value.

3. Potassium Hydroxide (KOH)
   Used for: liquid soap, cream soap, shaving soap.
   Physical form: white flakes or powder.
   Purity: often 85–90% (check label).

Properties:
Produces liquid or soft soap.
Highly soluble in water.
Requires more lye per gram of oil than NaOH (because of lower molecular weight).
Also requires more water.
Formula Behavior:
Lye concentration is often lower (20–30%).
Water:lye ratios are usually 3:1 up to 5:1.
Must adjust for purity:
If purity <100%:
Required KOH = NaOH SAP value × (100 ÷ purity%)
Example: If purity is 90%:
Needed KOH = Calculated KOH × (100/90) = ×1.11

4. NaOH vs KOH (Quick Comparison)
   Feature NaOH KOH
   Soap type Hard bar soap Liquid or soft soap
   Solubility Lower Very high
   Hardness Produces solid bars Produces gel/paste/liquid
   Water needs Lower Higher
   Typical purity 95–100% 85–95%
   Lye concentration 28–40% 20–30%
   Water ratio 2:1–3:1 3:1–5:1
5. Mixed Lye (NaOH + KOH)
   Some soap makers combine both to create:

Cream soap
Shaving soap
Very bubbly bar soap
Common mixes:

60% KOH / 40% NaOH for hybrid soaps. 6. SAP Values Depend on Lye Type
Each oil has two SAP values:

One for NaOH
One for KOH
KOH SAP values are about 1.403 times NaOH values.
Example (Olive Oil):

NaOH SAP ≈ 0.134
KOH SAP ≈ 0.188 7. Water Requirements vs Lye Type
For NaOH (bar soap):
Water% of oils: 30–38%
Lye concentration: 28–40%
Water:lye ratio: 2–3:1
For KOH (liquid soap):
Water% of oils: 50–80%
Lye concentration: 20–30%
Water:lye ratio: 3–5:1

1. Converting NaOH Formulas to KOH
   You convert solid soap formulas (NaOH) to liquid soap formulas (KOH) by adjusting:

Lye type
SAP value differences
Lye purity
Water requirements
Step 1 — Convert NaOH SAP to KOH SAP
KOH SAP = NaOH SAP × 1.403

Example (Olive Oil):
NaOH SAP = 0.134
KOH SAP = 0.134 × 1.403 = 0.188

You must use the KOH SAP values when calculating.

Step 2 — Calculate KOH needed
KOH (pure) = Oil Weight × KOH SAP

Example:
Oil = 1000 g olive
KOH SAP = 0.188

Pure KOH needed = 1000 × 0.188 = 188 g

Step 3 — Correct for Purity
Most KOH sold for liquid soap is 85–95% purity.
You must increase the amount you use.

Formula:
Adjusted KOH = Pure KOH / Purity%

Example:
Purity = 90% (0.90)
Adjusted KOH = 188 / 0.90 = 209 g

Step 4 — Adjust the Water
Liquid soap needs more water.
Typical water : KOH ratio = 3:1 to 5:1

Example (3:1):
Water = 209 × 3 = 627 g

2. Adjusting Lye for Superfatting
   Superfatting = intentionally using less lye than needed.

Formula:
Lye Needed = Full Lye × (1 − Superfat%)

Superfat% must be in decimal form.

Example:
Full NaOH = 140 g
Superfat = 5% = 0.05
NaOH used = 140 × (1 − 0.05) = 140 × 0.95 = 133 g

Superfat ranges:
Soap Type Recommended Superfat
General CP/HP 5%
High olive 2–5%
High coconut (drying) 8–20%
Shaving soap 3–5%
Liquid soap (KOH) 0–3% (very low)
Liquid soap needs very low superfat because extra oil can cloud the final product.
